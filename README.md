# Welcome to my Simple Task Management application

## Getting Started

First, install the package, I did add legacy command as some dependency is using the older version of react, but don't worry it will work fine:

```bash
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
